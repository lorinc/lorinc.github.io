# Build Something That Thinks. Now.

I help companies run their first ***AI pilot*** project with measurable ROI â€” something real, useful, and done ***in 30 days***. It pays for itself and teaches your team what works (and what doesn't).

> I'm an ex-Google Technical Product Owner with a background in AI and machine learning. I will help you finding the right use case for your first AI pilot, build it, and train your team to copy the process.
